### üìä Dashboard Overview
Each farmland dashboard presents key GIS data, including:
- **Organic Carbon**: Enhances soil structure and fertility.
- **Inorganic Carbon**: Affects soil pH and indicates degradation.
- **Soil Depth**: Determines root zone depth for water and nutrient uptake.
- **NDVI & FNDVI**: Monitor vegetation health and crop growth.
- **Soil Texture**: Influences water retention and crop suitability.
- **Rabi-Kharif-Fallow Patterns**: Indicate crop rotation and land usage.
- **Land Degradation Factors**: Salt-affected soil, water erosion, wind erosion.
- **Soil Moisture & Water Logging**: Affect irrigation needs and crop yields.
- **Vegetation Fraction**: Insights into land cover and conservation.
- **Forest Cover & Fire Risk**: Critical for long-term productivity.
