<Abstract xml:space="preserve">Fire regime over India was analysed using the MODIS fire record from 2003 to 2016.
The analysis used AQUA MODIS daytime fires for the 2003 – 2016 time period. Only detections with a detection confidence of over 10% and flagged as forest by using the NRSC forest fraction layer were used in the analysis.
Fire occurrence over India was spatially analyzed using 5 km grid to compute the average fire density, seasonality and inter-annual variability, following by Chuveico et al (2008) . 
The Average fire density (AFD) is the density of detected fires over all years and months and its standard deviation (SDAFD) and is measure by counts km-2 month-1 for each grid cell. The length of fire period (LFP) is a measure of the number of months with significant fire activity, calculated as number of months with greater than 10% of the annual fire density.
